# Machine-Learning-Preprocessing-CLI

- Developed a efficient command-line tool to automate preprocessing steps for machine learning datasets, Implemented robust handling of NULL values, encoding of categorical data, and feature scaling
- Provides developers with an efficient and convenient solution to prepare datasets for machine learning algorithms

## Steps to run 
while running the python file make sure that the DATASET you want to preprocss is in the same folder 
To run the " Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI "
-- run CLI.py file 

## COMMAND 
--(( python CLI.py datasetname.csv ))--
providing the dataset name is important only then you can preprocess the required dataset

### Future Scope 
developing an GUI or web page will make it more convenient
